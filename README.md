# hello-world
This is my first repository. I am going to use it to help show my growth over time.

I am actually a band director at an elementary school. After going at it for four years, I started looking at coding and found myself fascinated with what all you can create, and the process of having to creatively problem-solve.

I look forward to seeing and learn from the work of others, and the potential to collaborate as well.
